at development time, or it can be added upon first encountering the
certificate or public key. The former - adding at development time - is
preferred since preloading the certificate or public key out of band usually
means the attacker cannot taint the pin.",,"Certificate Pinning can be done with these two options:

You can 1\. pin the certificate or 2\. pin the public key

If you choose public keys, you have two additional choices: \- pin the
`subjectPublicKeyInfo` or \- pin one of the concrete types such as
`RSAPublicKey` or `DSAPublicKey`.

The three choices are explained below in more detail. I would encourage you to
pin the subjectPublicKeyInfo because it has the public parameters (such as
{e,n} for an RSA public key) and contextual information such as an algorithm
and OID. The context will help you keep your bearings at times, and the figure
to the right shows the additional information available.

### Certificate

The certificate is easiest to pin. You can fetch the certificate out of band
for the website, have the IT folks email your company certificate to you, use
openssl s_client to retrieve the certificate etc. At runtime, you retrieve the
website or server's certificate in the callback. Within the callback, you
compare the retrieved certificate with the certificate embedded within the
program. If the comparison fails, then fail the method or function. There is a
downside to pinning a certificate. If the site rotates its certificate on a
regular basis, then your application would need to be updated regularly. For
example, Google rotates its certificates, so you will need to update your
application about once a month (if it depended on Google services). Even
though Google rotates its certificates, the underlying public keys (within the
certificate) remain static.

### Public Key

Public key pinning is more flexible but a little trickier due to the extra
steps necessary to extract the public key from a certificate. As with a
certificate, the program checks the extracted public key with its embedded
copy of the public key. There are two downsides to public key pinning. First,
it's harder to work with keys (versus certificates) since you must extract the
key from the certificate. Extraction is a minor inconvenience in Java and
.Net, buts it's uncomfortable in Cocoa/CocoaTouch and OpenSSL. Second, the key
is static and may violate key rotation policies.

### Hashing

While the three choices above used DER encoding, its also acceptable to use a
hash of the information. In fact, the original sample programs were written
using digested certificates and public keys. The samples were changed to allow
a programmer to inspect the objects with tools like dumpasn1 and other ASN.1
decoders.

Hashing also provides three additional benefits. First, hashing allows you to
anonymize a certificate or public key. This might be important if you
application is concerned about leaking information during decompilation and
re-engineering. Second, a digested certificate fingerprint is often available
as a native API for many libraries, so its convenient to use. Finally, an
organization might want to supply a reserve (or back-up) identity in case the
primary identity is compromised. Hashing ensures your adversaries do not see
the reserved certificate or public key in advance of its use. In fact,
Google's IETF draft websec-key-pinning uses the technique.","In the event that a user (anonymous or verified) is able to execute over-
privileged functionality, the business may experience:

The application does not implement a virtual keyboard service and thus is
vulnerable to keylogger attacks","Keyloggers are malicious software designed to capture and record keystrokes or
input data from users, posing a significant threat to personal and sensitive
information. They operate by monitoring keyboard activity, potentially
stealing passwords, credit card details, and other confidential data.
Keylogger protection involves implementing secure input methods, such as
custom keyboards and virtual keyboards, to prevent unauthorized access to
typed information. Effective protection ensures that even if a keylogger is
present, it cannot intercept or compromise the data being entered.",,"Application should utilize a virtual or custom keyboard. By doing so, the app
can prevent keyloggers from capturing sensitive input. Below is an example of
how to implement a virtual keyboard.

Create a new service

    
    
    class MyInputMethodService : InputMethodService() {
        override fun onCreateInputView(): View {
            val keyboardView = layoutInflater.inflate(R.layout.keyboard_view, null) as KeyboardView
            return keyboardView
        }
    }
    

Create an Input Method XML Configuration

    
    
    <?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""utf-8""?>
    <input-method xmlns:android=""http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android""
        android:settingsActivity="".SettingsActivity""

            android:mode=""keyboard""
            android:imeSubtypeLocale=""en_US""/>
    </input-method>
    

Create the keyboard layout XML

    
    
    <?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""utf-8""?>
    <Keyboard xmlns:android=""http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"">
        <Row>
            <Key android:codes=""113"" android:keyLabel=""Q"" />
            <Key android:codes=""119"" android:keyLabel=""W"" />
            <!-- Add more keys as needed -->
        </Row>
        <!-- Add more rows as needed -->
    </Keyboard>
    

Create the keyboard view layout

    
    
    <?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""utf-8""?>
    <LinearLayout xmlns:android=""http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android""
        android:orientation=""vertical""

            android:layout_width=""match_parent""
            android:layout_height=""wrap_content""/>
    </LinearLayout>
    

Implement the keyboard logic and events

    
    
    class MyInputMethodService : InputMethodService(), KeyboardView.OnKeyboardActionListener {
        private lateinit var keyboardView: KeyboardView
        private lateinit var keyboard: Keyboard
        override fun onCreateInputView(): View {

            keyboard = Keyboard(this, R.xml.keyboard_layout)
            keyboardView.keyboard = keyboard
            keyboardView.setOnKeyboardActionListener(this)
            return keyboardView
        }
        override fun onKey(primaryCode: Int, keyCodes: IntArray) {
            val inputConnection = currentInputConnection
            inputConnection?.commitText(primaryCode.toChar().toString(), 1)
        }
    }
    

Add the service declaration in the manifest with correct permissions

    
    
    <service
        android:name="".MyInputMethodService""
        android:permission=""android.permission.BIND_INPUT_METHOD"">

without verifying their signature. This means that an attacker could
potentially forge a JWT with arbitrary claims and gain unauthorised access.
This issue is particularly problematic if the server does not properly
validate the presence of a signature or if it accepts tokens with an algorithm
set to ""none"". The scanner identifies APIs that are vulnerable by sending JWTs
with the ""none"" algorithm and checking if the server accepts these tokens
without signature validation","A non-compliant implementation is one that accepts JWTs with the ""none""
algorithm or fails to verify the signature. Here is an example of such

using a secure algorithm and that the server properly verifies the signature.

    RewriteRule .* – [F]
    

Alternatively, note that Apache versions 1.3.34, 2.0.55, and 2.2 support
disabling the TRACE method natively via the ‘TraceEnable’ directive.

# Microsoft IIS

The TRACK method can be added to Microsoft’s URLScan DenyVerbs section. It
should not be in the AllowVerbs section in the urlscan.ini file.

Use the URL Scan Tool to deny HTTP TRACE requests or to permit only the
methods needed to meet site requirements and policy. The default
configurations of Urlscan 2.5 (both baseline and SRP) only permit GET and HEAD
methods.

# NGINX

The majority of web sites only require the GET, HEAD & POST HTTP methods.
Enabling the TRACE or DELETE method can pose a risk to your server leaving it
vulnerable to a Cross-Site Tracking attack.

Modify the default.conf file and add the following under “server block” to
mitigate the risk of a Cross-Site Tracking attack.

SDK has built-in support for SQLite databases. The main package used to manage
the databases is android.database.sqlite. You may use the following code to
store sensitive information within an activity:

    
    
    SQLiteDatabase notSoSecure = openOrCreateDatabase(""privateNotSoSecure"",MODE_PRIVATE,null);
    notSoSecure.execSQL(""CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Accounts(Username VARCHAR, Password VARCHAR);"");

Once the activity has been called, the database file privateNotSoSecure will
be created with the provided data and stored in the clear text file
`/data/data/<package-name>/databases/privateNotSoSecure`","  1. Wherever possible you must avoid storing sensitive data within your app.
  2. Use libraries like SQLcipher to encrypt the information stored
  3. set `""allow backup=false""` to avoid exploiting data using ADB

With the library SQLCipher, SQLite databases can be password-encrypted.

    
    
    SQLiteDatabase secureDB = SQLiteDatabase.openOrCreateDatabase(database, ""password123"", null);

hard-coded in the source, stored in shared preferences, or hidden somewhere
else in the code or filesystem. Secure ways to retrieve the key include:

  * Asking the user to decrypt the database with a PIN or password once the app is opened (weak passwords and PINs are vulnerable to brute force attacks)
